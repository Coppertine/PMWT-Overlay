PMWT Steaming Overlay
-----------------------
Designed by cloudical / Coppertine
Developed by Coppertine using parts from lil onion, Hoaq and VictimCrasher's overlays.


Setup
=======

Create a profile on OBS Studio (optimised for streaming, using base of 1080p and using the stream key in #streamers) 
Import the PMWT.json file in Scene Collection -> Import.
Go to Edit -> Advanced Audio Properties and set the Audio Monitoring section for "osu! Audio" and "Tourney Audio" to "Monitor and Output"

Copy paste osu!.exe to the osu folder and run it, log in (with username and password remembered). Close and copy / paste the tournament.cfg file into the osu folder and run the executable.

In GosuMemory folder, start the gosumemory.exe. To see if it works, restart OBS or click on "Gosumemory" Source and hit "Refresh".


Navigation
==========
A lot of the scenes will be controlled from the OBS scenes on the left and are mostly self explanitory, however there are no timers in this overlay.
(cuz lazy)

Go to Tournament Client to show the main tournament match.
Go to Showcase if you are doing mappool showcases (this only works for a osu! resolution of 1280 x 720)
Go to Seeding if you want to do lazer... why?
Any others will show the text and an icon as an intermission scene.
